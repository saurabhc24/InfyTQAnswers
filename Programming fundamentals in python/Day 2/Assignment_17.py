"""
An organization has decided to provide salary hike to its employees based on their job level. Employees can be in job levels 3 , 4 or 5.
Hike percentage based on job levels are given below:

+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
| Job level | Hike Percentage (applicable on current salary) |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
|     3     |                     15                         |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
|     4     |                      7                         |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
|     5     |                      5                         |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------+

In case of invalid job level, consider hike percentage to be 0.

Given the current salary and job level, write a python program to find and display the new salary of an employee. Identify the test data and use it to test the program.
