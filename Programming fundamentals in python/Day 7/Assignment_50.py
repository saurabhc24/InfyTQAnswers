"""
Write python function, sms_encoding() which accepts a sentence and converts it into an abbreviated sentence to be sent as SMS and returns the abbreviated sentence.
Rules are as follows:
a. Spaces are to be retained as is
b. Each word should be encoded separately
If a word has only vowels then retain the word as is
If a word has a consonant (at least 1) then retain only those consonants
Note: Assume that the sentence would begin with a word and there will be only a single space between the words.
